Arcrane is an IoT-enabled project leveraging a Raspberry Pi to create a smart crane system designed for remote monitoring and operation. It integrates sensors (e.g., load, position, or motion sensors), actuators, and connectivity modules to provide real-time control using joystick interfaces. 

Arcrane IoT project key components below:

1. Hardware Setup

Raspberry Pi: 
    • The brain of your project. (Model 3B+, 4, or newer for better performance)
Sensors:
    • Load Sensors: For weight measurement.
    • Position Sensors: Such as encoders or ultrasonic sensors for crane arm position tracking.
    • Proximity Sensors: To avoid collisions.
Actuators:
    • Motors (e.g., stepper or DC motors with controllers) for crane movement.
Connectivity:
    •  Wi-Fi or Ethernet for IoT communication.
Power Management:
    • Ensure suitable power supplies for the Raspberry Pi and peripherals.

2. Software Components

Operating System:
    • Raspberry Pi OS (recommended for compatibility).
Programming Languages:
    • Python (primary language for IoT applications).
Libraries and Frameworks:
    • RPi.GPIO or gpiozero for controlling GPIO pins.
    • MQTT for IoT communication.
    • Flask/Django for creating a web interface.

3. Features to Implement

Basic Crane Control:
    •  Motorized movement controlled via GPIO pins.
Live Feed
    •  A camera to see how the crane moves.    
Remote Access:
    •  Control the crane from anywhere using a secure web.

4. Safety and Optimization
    • Optimize network bandwidth and latency for smooth IoT operations.
